We first developed a C serial version of the VCA algorithm and three parallel versions: one using NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), another using CUDA basic linear algebra subroutines library CUBLAS, and the last using the CUDA linear algebra library CULA. Experimental results, based on the analysis of hyperspectral images acquired by a variety of hyperspectral imaging sensors, show the effectiveness of our implementation, which satisfies the real-time constraints given by the data acquisition rate.},

  abstract = {The current study addresses the problem of the identification of each natural material present in each pixel of a hyperspectral image. Two end member extraction methods from hyperspectral imagery were studied: the N-FindR method and the independent component analysis (ICA). The N-FindR is an automatic technique that selects extreme points (end members) of an n- dimensional scatter plot. It assumes the existence of pure pixels in the distribution, which is infrequent in practice. ICA is a blind source separation technique studied in the signal processing community, which allows each spectrum of natural elements (end member spectra) to be extracted from the observation of some linear combinations of these. It considers a more realistic situation than N-FindR, assuming a spectra mixture for all the pixels. To increase the robustness of ICA, continuum-removed reflectance spectra were used and an iterative algorithm was introduced that takes into account a major part of the available information. The end member abundances were estimated by the fully constrained least squares spectral mixture analysis (FLCS). The end member identification and quantification were carried out on two surficial formations of a semi arid region located in the Rehoboth region, in Namibia, from hyperspectral Hyperion data. It appears that the two end member extraction methods have a similar potential. Whichever end member extraction method is used, the analysis of the rock abundance maps produces a lot of geological information: the distribution of natural elements is in line with the field observations and allows the description of the formation processes of surficial units.},

  abstract = {Endmember extraction represents one of the most challenging aspects of hyperspectral image processing. In this letter, a new algorithm for endmember extraction, named modified vertex component analysis (MVCA), is presented. This new technique outperforms the popular vertex component analysis (VCA) by applying a low-complexity orthogonalization method and by utilizing integer instead of floating-point arithmetic when dealing with hyperspectral data. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated by comparing its performance with VCA on synthetic mixtures as well as on the well-known Cuprite hyperspectral image. MVCA shows promising results in terms of much lower computational complexity, still reproducing similar endmember accuracy than its original counterpart. Moreover, the features of this algorithm combined with state-of-the-art hardware implementations qualify MVCA as a good potential candidate for all those applications in which real time is a must.},

It aims at estimating the number of reference substances, also called endmembers, their spectral signature and abundance fractions, using only the observed data (mixed pixels). This paper presents new method that performs unsupervised endmember extraction from hyperspectral data. The algorithm exploits a simple geometric fact: endmembers are vertices of a simplex. The algorithm complexity, measured in floating points operations, is O ( n ), where n is the sample size. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated using simulated data.},

  abstract = {The analysis of hyperspectral data sets requires the determination of certain basis spectra called 'end-members.' Once these spectra are found, the image cube can be 'unmixed' into the fractional abundance of each material in each pixel. There exist several techniques for accomplishing the determination of the end-members, most of which involve the intervention of a trained geologist. Often these-end-members are assumed to be present in the image, in the form of pure, or unmixed, pixels. In this paper a method based upon the geometry of convex sets is proposed to find a unique set of purest pixels in an image. The technique is based on the fact that in N spectral dimensions, the N-volume contained by a simplex formed of the purest pixels is larger than any other volume formed from any other combination of pixels. The algorithm works by 'inflating' a simplex inside the data, beginning with a random set of pixels. For each pixel and each end-member, the end-member is replaced with the spectrum of the pixel and the volume is recalculated. If it increases, the spectrum of the new pixel replaces that end-member. This procedure is repeated until no more replacements are done. This algorithm successfully derives end-members in a synthetic data set, and appears robust with less than perfect data. Spectral end-members have been extracted for the AVIRIS Cuprite data set which closely match reference spectra, and resulting abundance maps match published mineral maps.},
