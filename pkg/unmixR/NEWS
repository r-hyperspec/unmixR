Changes in version 0.2-0 2016-?-?
     + unmixR is currently undergoing a significant round of improvements.  This work is expected to be completed by fall 2016.  Check back for details.

Changes in version 0.1-6 2014-06-09
     + Added functions spectraDist and abundanceImage.  Testing shows these give good results with the MUD_A data set.

Changes in version 0.1-5 2014-06-05
     + Changed roxygen2 settings for predict, nfindr.default, nfindr.formula, vca.formula & vca.default.  It is no longer necessary for S3 methods to be declared but you must export the methods.  All you need to write is simply use @export, roxygen2 seems to figure it all out.
     + Changes made yesterday to .simplex were probably not necessary but do no harm.  Had forgotten that nfindr.default was doing the pca before .simplex was called.
     + Found an error in nfindrBrute where the data was not being transposed.  See note in file.  Runs now.
 
Changes in version 0.1-4 2014-06-04
     + Made sure all vca and nfindr functions sorted their indices before returning them.
     + Restored nfindrLDU.R which had been deleted at some point.
     + Made sure the documentation was consistent regarding the indices.  
     + NOTE: See the documentation for the return value of vca05.  I may have broken something when I made the 2nd change listed for version 0.1-3.

Changes in version 0.1-3 2014-06-04
     + Now exports most everything, even if only for troubleshooting convenience.
     + Modified vca05 so it returns only the indices, which is consistent with what all other vca and nfindr functions do.  Fixed the class definition in vca.default accordingly.

Changes in version 0.1-2 2014-05-29
     + Now builds and checks WITH the unit tests, except that one of the vca.formula tests was behaving badly and was commented out, AND, all tests involving .testdata are commented out, which is related to the next item, still a work in progress.
     + Corrected what I think were some errors in estSNR (see notes within the file).  Also set some traps to monitor the SNR.  With .testdata, which is noiseless(?), one can get some pretty odd answers.  Not sure if this is the final solution to this problem.
     + Modified .testdata in unittests.R so that the column names were consistent (a cosmetic fix).
     + Still needs extensive testing.

Changes in version 0.1-1 2014-05-28
     + Fixed collate order so that the svUnit framework is fully visible.  Tests still fail.
     + Still needs extensive testing.

Changes in version 0.1-0 2014-05-26
     + Builds and checks when skipping vignettes and unit tests.
     + Still needs extensive testing.
